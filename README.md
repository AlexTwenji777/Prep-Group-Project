## __Electricity Consumption in Kenya__ ##

---
## _Description_ ##
Kenya’s goal is to reach 100% electricity connectivity by 2022 while enabling a green, clean driven economy. 
This means 100% sustainable energy in terms of electricity generation and consumption. Additionally, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, Kenya committed itself to tackling climate change. 
The country’s determined contribution (National Determined Contribution), which is pegged on the 2013 Kenya Climate Change Action Plan, promises to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by 2030 from 2015 (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources 2015). 
There is a need to track the consumption of energy over the years.
